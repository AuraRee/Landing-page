Designing a web page using HTML &amp; CSS

Project: Landing-page Project 

I am going to construct an entire web page.

By designing and building this website I will be displaying my extensive knowledge of web development/designing by using the skills I hone of HTML and incorporation of CSS into HTML to style web pages.

Reflection: 

This project turned out better than my expectations. It took me longer than I expected - 3days T_T - but in the end it's all worth it. It ended having a futuristic design because of the neon borders I put around containers / items.
The intent first for the borders were to help me see the containers clearly and be able to designate them to style and put them in the correct layout accordingly. But after seeing that it actually makes of a lovely design, I'll just keep it.
This allowed me to display my creativity and my skills to drive the operation of the tools in css and html and in incorporating of them both to create a web page from scratch!
